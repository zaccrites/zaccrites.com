The year is 2001.
My dad brings home a copy of Wally Wang's *Visual Basic 6 for Dummies*.

I made a ton of toy programs. I don't remember the details of most of them,
but I do remember one that used some pictures of the phases of the moon
that came with the IDE. Clicking on the picture would change a label's
text to give the name of the phase.

I remember meeting my dad and one of his work friends for lunch in Waukegan
and describing how I made a status bar control change text when I moused over it.
My dad's friend acted amazed, as if no one had ever been able to do that before.
I was so *proud* of what I was able to make the computer do.

Eventually I left VB6 for VB.NET, which was undoubtedly the better platform.
And eventually I learned C# and C++ and left VB.NET behind too.
These languages aren't spoken of fondly by many on the internet,
but I remember them very fondly.
Just the thought of the VB6 IDE fills me with a nostalgic warmth.




The first language I ever learned.
Can I still download it through DreamSpark or Imagine or whatever?
Does it still work?
Can I try it out and see how it feels?

Apparently ByRef was the default in VB6 but this changed to ByVal in VB.NET

The genesis of my career.
